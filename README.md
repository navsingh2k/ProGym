Front-End GYM website using HTML,CSS, and Media queries.
My project is on website development. In this I created a website for a GYM. Having a website and online presence strategy allows you to market your business online. A website is also important because it helps to establish credibility as a business. Websites usually provide a map and directions to the company's shops or offices for visitors to find their location easily.This front-end website developed with the help of HTML and CSS. Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. It is fully responsive website developed by using Media queries. Media queries are a feature of CSS that enable webpage content to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. They are a fundamental part of responsive web design and are used to customize the appearance of websites for multiple devices.
